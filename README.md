# iOS-Boilerplate

This is a simple boilerplate Xcode project

# What does it have?

- Application Stylesheet
- Removed storyboard
- Updated AppDelegate
- Basic directory structure (Xcode groups match directories)
- PCH
- Cocoapods with some great baseline pods
- Solid .gitignore

# Project Setup

- Rename the project ![rename](http://i.imgur.com/ZKw74lO.png "Rename Xcode Project")
- Rename your target in the Podfile
- Swap the `ViewController` in `AppDelegate.m` with your root view controller
- Run `pod install` from `Terminal` in your root directory (where the `Podfile` is)
